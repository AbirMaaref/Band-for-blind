Title of the project:
Band for the blind


Description:
A system that allows blind people to detect
obstacles in front of them using a mobile app to
give them a warning .

Objectif:
-a small way that can protect their lives
-they felt they were a little far from the dangers


List of devices:
ESP32 card
Ultrasonic sensor
Male and/or female wires/pins


Installation and prepartion instrcutions: 
- coding in arduino IDE environment 
- wiring ultrasonic sensor which it have 4 pins : GND ---> GND pin of ESP32
                                                  VCC ---> 5V pin of ESP32
                                                  TRIGGER_PIN ---> pin 12
                                                  ECHO_PIN ---> pin 13
- manipulated with a mobile application in App Inventor  ( code : image insered in GitHub )
